### Revolutionizing Age Verification

As the Lead Designer at Arcoscan, I embarked on an ambitious project to transform the landscape of age verification for restricted products. Our vision was to create a seamless, biometric-based system that would eliminate the need for physical IDs while incentivizing users through targeted discounts.

### Balancing Innovation with User Trust

Our team faced a complex set of challenges:

1. User Experience: We needed to design a biometric age verification process that felt intuitive and non-intrusive, a crucial factor for user adoption.

2. Incentive Design: Creating compelling reasons for users to adopt new technology and share biometric data was essential.

3. Privacy Concerns: We had to address the inherent user hesitation about using biometric data for sensitive purchases like alcohol and tobacco.

4. Market Differentiation: In a competitive age verification market, our solution needed to stand out with unique features and benefits.

5. Technical Integration: The system had to seamlessly integrate with existing point-of-sale systems across various retailers.

### User-Centric Design and Strategic Pivoting

To tackle these challenges, we implemented a multi-faceted strategy:

1. Intuitive Interface Design: We developed a user-friendly interface for the face scan process, focusing on simplicity and clear communication of benefits.

2. Robust Incentive System: We created a comprehensive discount system for age-restricted products, providing a tangible benefit for users to adopt the technology.

3. Privacy-First Approach: Implementing strong data protection measures and transparent communication about our privacy policies was crucial in building user trust.

4. Cross-Functional Collaboration: I worked closely with the head of engineering and CEO to align our design with technical capabilities and business strategy.

5. Agile Development: We adopted an iterative approach, continuously refining the platform based on user feedback and market response.

### Market Insights and Strategic Pivot

Our journey with Arcoscan led to significant insights and a strategic shift:

- User Behavior Understanding: We gained valuable insights into user hesitations and preferences regarding biometric verification for age-restricted products.

- Market Realities: Initial user response highlighted the need for a shift in our approach to better align with market demands.

- Strategic Pivot: Based on our learnings, we're now pivoting towards a couponing platform that offers hyper-personalized discounts based on location.

- Refined Approach: We're maintaining the face scan as part of the onboarding process while focusing primarily on the couponing aspect, leveraging our existing technology in a new direction.

### The Value of Adaptability in Product Development

This project reinforced several crucial lessons:

1. User Trust is Paramount: When dealing with sensitive data like biometrics, building and maintaining user trust must be at the forefront of design decisions.

2. Market Feedback is Critical: Being receptive to market response and willing to pivot based on user feedback is essential for long-term success.

3. Technology Application Flexibility: Sometimes, the most valuable application of new technology isn't the one initially envisioned. Being open to new use cases can lead to unexpected opportunities.

4. Balancing Innovation and User Comfort: While pushing technological boundaries, it's crucial to ensure that the end product aligns with user comfort levels and market readiness.

### Redefining Personalized Discounts

The insights gained from our initial concept have led us to a promising new direction. By shifting our focus to location-based, personalized couponing while retaining the biometric element for onboarding, we're evolving to meet market demands more effectively.

As we continue to refine our approach, Arcoscan is positioning itself to offer unique value in the personalized discount space. We're excited about the potential to revolutionize how users access deals on a wide range of products, leveraging our biometric technology in a way that aligns more closely with current market needs and user preferences.

This experience highlights the value of rapid iteration and willingness to pivot based on user feedback and market realities. It's not just about the technology you build, but how you apply it to solve real user problems in a way that resonates with the market.
