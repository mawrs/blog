### Trouble Phishing

In 2020, Square experienced a significant increase in phishing scams via email, resulting in millions of dollars lost by Square sellers who were unable to recover their funds.

This prompted Square to double down on their fraud prevention efforts, and ultimately to my hiring.

Before joining the team, I was made aware that <span style="background-color: yellow;">82% of sellers had difficulty distinguishing legitimate Square emails from scams due
to inconsistent branding and design.</span>

### Revolutionizing Email Security at Square

As a Product Designer on the Payment Acceptance Fraud team at Square, I collaborated with a large cross-functional team to fortify our email
security through innovative design standardization. Our mission was clear: enhance seller trust and significantly
reduce financial losses stemming from email phishing scams.

<span style="background-color: yellow;">I had the unique opportunity to own parts of the Email Design and UX Writing, requiring me to have a
deep understanding of our existing design system and brand guidelines.</span>
‚Äç
My attempts at UX Writing were overseen by our real UX Writer who oversaw the Risk department. Not to mention my weekly check-ins with fellow Product Designers,
UX Researchers, and the Product Design Manager.

### Unifying a Fragmented System

Square's email communications with users were spread across 10 different departments, each with its own unique design approach. This fragmentation not only
created inconsistency in brand presentation but also made it challenging for sellers to distinguish legitimate Square emails from potential phishing attempts.

Our task was to create a unified design system that could accommodate the diverse needs of each department while simultaneously improving sellers' ability to
identify authentic Square communications. The stakes were high - every misidentified email could potentially lead to financial loss and erode the trust Square had worked so hard to build.

### Collaboration and User-Centric Design

To gain buy-in, <span style="background-color: yellow;">we conducted weekly workshops with stakeholders from each department to understand their specific needs, all
while expressing our
concerns and design goals.</span> After every workshop, we translated their feedback into potential design
components that would be reusable across other departments. This ensured a more flexible and scalable solution to the problem, while still meeting the diverse communication
needs of the teams.

### Testing and Iterations

My design partner and I collaborated with the UX Researcher to test the newly designed emails against our original emails, which had a 18% success rate. Although I didn't have the privledge of interiewing the sellers myself, I was able to write our user testing script and design the test.

With a focus group of 15 sellers, we reached a 40% improvement in their ability to identify legitimate Square emails. Based on this feedback, we refined the designs further,
particularly focusing on creating consistent body, header, and footer components that could be highly modular across all departments.

    />
    <figcaption class="text-center mt-2 text-sm text-gray-600">

  </figure>
</div>

These components covered ~90% of the everyday use cases for the company. Edge cases still had to be designed from scratch, depending on the department & event. <span style="background-color: yellow;">We created all the necessary designs and components using Figma, and integrated into Contenful for faster implementation.</span> By consolidating our work into a select few, we were able to streamline the email design process and facilitate easier adoption across the entire company.

### A Safer, More Trusted Platform

The results of our efforts were gradual, and six months after the launch of our new email designs we starting seeing the fruits of our labor:

- Phishing Attempts Plummeted: We saw a <span style="background-color: yellow;">12.5% decrease in reported phishing attempts</span>, a clear indication that our standardized design was making it easier for sellers to identify legitimate Square communications.

- Financial Protection Strengthened: Most importantly, we achieved a <span style="background-color: yellow;">70% reduction in financial losses due to email scams.</span> This not only protected our sellers but also reinforced Square's reputation as a secure platform for business transactions.

- Seller Confidence Soared: Going back to our original becnhamrk, we observed a <span style="background-color: yellow;">90% increase in seller confidence</span> when it came to identifying legitimate Square emails. This boost in trust is invaluable for maintaining strong, long-term relationships with our sellers.

### The Power of Design in Security

This project reinforced a crucial lesson: design plays a pivotal role in security. By creating a consistent, easily recognizable email design, we were able to significantly enhance our sellers' ability to identify legitimate Square communications, and in turn protect them from financial loss.
