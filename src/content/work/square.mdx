### Revolutionizing Email Security at Square

As a Product Designer on the Payment Acceptance Fraud team at Square, I collaborated with a cross-functional team to spearhead a project that aimed to redefine email security through innovative design standardization. Our mission was clear: enhance seller trust and significantly reduce financial losses stemming from email phishing scams.

### Unifying a Fragmented System

The landscape we faced was complex and multifaceted. Square's email communications were spread across seven different departments, each with its own unique design approach. This fragmentation not only created inconsistency in brand presentation but also made it challenging for sellers to distinguish legitimate Square emails from potential phishing attempts.

Our task was to create a unified design system that could accommodate the diverse needs of each department while simultaneously improving sellers' ability to identify authentic Square communications. The stakes were high - every misidentified email could potentially lead to financial loss and erode the trust Square had worked so hard to build.

### Collaboration and User-Centric Design

To tackle this challenge, we adopted a comprehensive, collaborative approach:

1. Design Audit: We began with a thorough audit of existing email designs across all seven departments. This gave us a clear picture of the inconsistencies we needed to address and highlighted best practices we could build upon.

2. Cross-Departmental Collaboration: We worked closely with UX Writers, fellow Product Designers, and representatives from each department. This collaborative effort ensured that our standardized design could meet the unique communication needs of every team.

3. User-Centric Framework: Drawing on our audit findings and departmental input, we developed a unified design framework. This framework maintained Square's brand identity while introducing clear visual cues to help sellers easily identify legitimate emails.

4. Iterative Testing: We partnered with UX Researchers to conduct extensive user testing. This allowed us to refine our designs based on real seller feedback, ensuring that our solution truly met their needs.

### A Safer, More Trusted Platform

The results of our efforts were both immediate and significant:

- Phishing Attempts Plummeted: We saw a 12.5% decrease in reported phishing attempts, a clear indication that our standardized design was making it easier for sellers to identify legitimate Square communications.

- Financial Protection Strengthened: Most importantly, we achieved a staggering 70% reduction in financial losses due to email scams. This not only protected our sellers but also reinforced Square's reputation as a secure platform for business transactions.

- Seller Confidence Soared: We observed a 90% increase in seller confidence when it came to identifying legitimate Square emails. This boost in trust is invaluable for maintaining strong, long-term relationships with our sellers.

### The Power of Design in Security

This project reinforced a crucial lesson: design plays a pivotal role in security. By creating a consistent, easily recognizable email design, we were able to significantly enhance our
