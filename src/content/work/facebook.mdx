### What are Public Figures?

On Facebook, people can engage with public figures that matter to them — from creators, authors, athletes and sports teams, to musicians, bands, journalists and celebrities.
‍

Currently, these public figures use a range of Facebook tools to connect with their communities. For example, Brittany Howard of the Alabama Shakes announced her debut solo album via a personal Note. Video creator David Dobrik has grown his fan base rapidly on Facebook through interacting with fans on his latest videos and building a connected fan group. And ABC News Chief Meteorologist Ginger Zee goes live often to share real-time updates with followers, covering major weather events like the recent heat waves.

As of 2021, the goal is now to increase overall engagement between public figures and their audiences.

### Connecting Public Figures and Audiences on Facebook

As a Product Designer on the Discovery & Distribution team, I had the priveledge of building new features and improve existing tools to help public figures stay connected with their audiences.

Some notable features I worked on were:

*   Admin Notifications Center: An entry point to custom settings, tabs, and highlights to allow admins of public figure accounts to have more control over their notifications and make it easier to find.
*   Cross-Profile Notifications: A brand new concept, allowing admins of multiple public figures to view all their notifications at once.
*   Top Fans: A new incentive to make it easier for fans to stand out when engaging with public figure content.

Within these projects, I worked alongside Designers, UX Researchers, PMs, and a Product Design Manager who oversaw the work our team was completing.

As a newcomer to this team, <span style="background-color: yellow;">my initial challenge was striking the right balance between design exploration and recycling existing components from our Facebook Design System.</span> After all, one of Facebook's design principles is to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/693790757917796/?_rdr" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"reduce, reuse, don't redesign."</a>


### Admin Notifications Center

Public figure accounts could receive upwards of 20,000 notifications in a single day, a tall order for anyone running that account. To improve the quality of life for the admins running these accounts, our team tested a new command center for notifications that would allow these admins to have an entry point to custom settings, tabs, and highlights designed just for them. 

With solid understanding of the product goal, <span style="background-color: yellow;">I worked closely with our UX Researcher to put together a game plan for user testing. I came up with 10 variations of this new Notifications Center and presented them to my team over a period of two weeks. The goal was to narrow this down to two variations for proper A/B testing.</span>

Throughout my design explorations, I found myself asking questions like:

*   Which tabs should be included?
*   Should they be configurable by the admin?
*   Should there be scrolling tabs off the screen?
*   Will highlights be confusing if it's already configurable?

Thanks to an awesome design team, I was able to land on two strong concepts for Notifications Center.

</div>
A/B testing these designs involved a lot of collaboration with the UX Researchers to nail down the script as well as the data synthesizing process. <span style="background-color: yellow;">We eventually got our qualitative results from user testing, and the prominent, clearly labeled static sub-tabs was easiest to understand for users.</span>

### Top Fans and Enhanced Interaction Tools

As another way of engaging public figures and their audiences, our same team started experimenting with incentives that would highlight dedicated followers of public figures. This initiative aimed to make it easier for fans to stand out when engaging with content from their favorite public figures.

Shaping the work for this new initiative required full collaboration from myself, my design buddy, PM, and Product Design Manager to scope out the end-to-end flow for this feature. To get a functioning prototype up and running, we landed on the following must-have features:

*   Top Fan badges: Visual indicators displayed next to usernames of highly engaged followers
*   Admin controls: Allowing public figures to manage their Top Fans, including options to remove or ban users
*   User controls: Enabling fans to display or remove their Top Fan badge
*   Notifications: Alerting users when they achieve Top Fan status

Initially, it was unclear whether this "gamification" approach would be successful. <span style="background-color: yellow;">I was responsible for leading the design exploration of the Admin Controls and User Controls, while my design buddy took charge of the Top Fan Badge and Notifications.</span>

The end-to-end flow was carefully mapped out to ensure a seamless experience for all users.

      alt="Remove Top Fan badges"
    />
    <figcaption className="text-center mt-2">Remove Top Fan badges</figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

Admin Controls and User Controls required a lot of understanding about the behaviors on the platform. I wouldn't have been able to design these features without the help of our UX Researcher, who was able to beautfilly distill all the data I needed to know for my designs.

We managed to get a functioning prototype up and running, and through further user testing and design Crits, we refined the Top Fans feature to meet the needs of both public figures and their followers.

With these design explorations, we were able to get a 360 degree view on this new initiative and get further validation from real users.

### Stronger Connections and Higher Engagement

The results of our efforts were pretty significant. <span style="background-color: yellow;">After several months of testing and refining, we saw a 15% increase in overall engagement between public figures and their audiences. More impressively, there was a 25% increase in comments and reactions from designated top fans.</span>

But numbers only tell part of the story. We received overwhelmingly positive feedback from both public figures and regular users about the enhanced connection features. Public figures reported feeling more connected to their core audience, while fans expressed excitement about the increased opportunities for interaction with their favorite celebrities.

### The Power of Thoughtful Design

This project reinforced the importance of balancing innovation with user familiarity. By carefully pushing the boundaries of Facebook's design system while maintaining its core essence, we were able to create features that felt both fresh and intuitive.

Moreover, we learned the value of deep user research in driving meaningful product improvements. By truly understanding the needs and behaviors of both public figures and their audiences, we were able to create features that resonated with both groups.

### The Future of Social Connections

The success of this project not only improved user experiences but also contributed to Facebook's broader goal of fostering more meaningful connections among its users. As we look to the future, we're excited to continue exploring new ways to bring people closer together through thoughtful, user-centered design.
