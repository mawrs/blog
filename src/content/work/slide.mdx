### Background

Slide Insurance, a Florida-based insurer, was preparing to acquire 163,000 policy holders from an incumbent who was going out of business. <span style="background-color: yellow;"> Slide approached Underbelly with a new challenge they were facing: Create a self-servied version of their 'File a Claim' process that would seamlessly integrate new and existing users, and that didn't require the need for a human representative.</span> This required a deep understanding of diverse user needs and an innovative approach to design.

### First, We Sprint

To truly understand the main problem and the needs of our customer, my team and I embarked on a week-long trip to Tampa, Florida to meet with Slide's executive team and insurance experts.

<span style="background-color: yellow;">As a team of three (a full-stack developer, a product manager, and myself), we conducted the Google Ventures Design Sprint to rapidly ideate and validate our assumptions.</span>

This consisted of a jam-packed 9-5 day, along with some late nights to distill our learnings from each day.

As the lead designer, my responsibilities included:

- Conducting roundtable discussions with stakeholders to guide design decisions.
- Creating wireframes, prototypes, and high-fidelity designs.
- Collaborating closely with our developer to ensure technical feasibility and implementation of design elements.
- Leading user testing sessions and incorporating feedback into design iterations.
- Developing a scalable design system and ensuring consistency across the platform.

### Adding some Constraints

As you may imagine, we came up with dozens of possible features and solution implementations for our core problem.

Ultimately, we had to narrow down our focus to a few key areas.

As a collective, we agreed on a core user flow that had the necessary features to solve the problem, and that we could build in a week.

### Scalability and Future-Proofing

Slide did not have a design system or UI kit for their existing application, so we decided to set them up with one. We utilized Tailwind
to start componentizing some of the work we were doing. Tailwind was the framework of choice for our developer, and our stakeholders were happy with it.

### End of Sprint Week

On the fifth and final day of our design sprint, we conducted user testing sessions with five policy holders and three Slide executives. This step was crucial in validating our
prototype and gathering real-world feedback. We set up two rooms: one for interviews and another for the sprint team to observe.

As the lead designer, I prepared our prototype and crafted some interview questions to guide the sessions. We carefully observed user interactions, paying attention to both
verbal and non-verbal cues. This process provided invaluable insights into the effectiveness of our claims process, helping us identify strengths and areas for
improvement. The immediate feedback allowed us to quickly assess which ideas worked, which didn't, and informed our next steps for refining the product.

This was one of the most challenging things I've done in my design career, but it was also one of the most rewarding. Everyone came out of that room extremely
satisfied with the results of the sprint, <span style="background-color: yellow;">and Slide even agreed to sign an adidtional 3-month contract to get the prototype into production.</span>

### 3-Month Product Development Phase

Following the sprint, I went back to managing my design team, but I continued to work closely with the Slide team to refine the product.

This 3-month phase included:
- Iterative Design Refinement: Weekly design reviews, continuous iteration based on user feedback, and optimization of user flows.
- Development of Comprehensive Design System: Continuing to create a scalable design system using Tailwind CSS, including a component library and documented guidelines.
- Cross-functional Collaboration and Testing: Working closely with engineering, product, and design teams to conducted regular user testing and A/B testing to optimize the claims process.
- Performance, Accessibility, and Compliance: Ensuring fast load times, WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, and adherence to insurance industry regulations while maintaining a user-friendly interface.

### Efficiency, Satisfaction, and Trust

The results of our efforts were transformative:

- Self-Serviceability: We achieved an impressive 89% completion rate for the new claim process, indicating that users found it intuitive and manageable.

- Time Efficiency: We dramatically reduced the average time to complete a claim from 20 minutes to just 8 minutes - a 60% improvement that significantly eased user frustration.

- Reduced Support Needs: Most important of all, we saw a 45% decrease in customer support calls related to the claim process. This not only indicated a more self-serviceable system but also translated to significant operational savings for Slide.

### Design-Driven Growth

The success of this sprint + development phase demonstrates the critical role of design in driving business growth, enhancing user satisfaction, and creating scalable solutions. As Lead Designer, I'm proud to have guided this project from concept to implementation, delivering tangible results that positively impacted both users and the business.

Slide's new and improved claims process has positioned them to be one of the top insurance companies in Florida. <span style="background-color: yellow;">In fact, [Slide recently acquired the renewal rights for Farmers Insurance homeowners policies in the state](https://www.slideinsurance.com/press-release/slide-acquires-renewal-rights-for-farmers-insurance-homeowners-policies-in-florida). This added an additional 86,000 policy holders to their platform.</span>
