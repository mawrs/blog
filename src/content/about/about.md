I'm Martin Tejeda, a product designer and builder focused on creating user-centered digital solutions. As the Head of Design at MDSV Capital, I combine design expertise with entrepreneurial skills to drive innovation and business growth.

My approach integrates UX research, UI design, and front-end development. I leverage cutting-edge AI tools like V0, Cursor, and Replit for rapid prototyping and product development. This allows me to quickly turn ideas into functional, intuitive products that solve real user problems.

I'm passionate about expanding my skill set and staying at the forefront of design and technology. My goal is to create digital products that are not only visually appealing but also effective and user-friendly.
