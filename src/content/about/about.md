I'm Martin Tejeda, a product designer and builder residing in San Fancisco, California. I'm currently the "Head of Design" at MDSV Capital, where I work alongside a 10x Engineer and a seasoned CEO to bring cool projects to life.

My product design approach integrates UX research, UI design, and front-end development. I leverage cutting-edge AI tools like V0, Cursor, and Replit for rapid prototyping and product development. This allows me to quickly turn ideas into functional products we can put in front of users.

I'm passionate about expanding my skill set and staying at the forefront of design and technology. My goal is to create digital products that are not only visually appealing but also effective and user-friendly.

If my background and M.O. interests you, let's grab some coffee.
